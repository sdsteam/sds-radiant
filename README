== SDS-Radiant

This version of Radiant has been modified to work with the Microsoft SQL Data Services REST interface as its data store. This 
was accomplished by writing a custom active record adapter that is shipped in the vendor folder. Some small changes were made to Radiant to accommodate using this adapter, but they were very small.

If you are writing an application from scratch the active record adapter is not the best way to use SDS you should use the sds-rest library and the sds-activeresource adapter that comes with it.

The active record adapter is still experimental and will not work in all active record scenarios, its has only been tested with Radiant.

To get started:

1. Install Ruby with the One-Click Installer - http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/29263/ruby186-26.exe
2. Install Ruby Gems - http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/38647/rubygems-1.2.0.zip
3. Install UUIDTools - cmd line => gem install uuidtools
4. Install Hoe - cmd line => gem install hoe
5. Install sds-rest - cmd line => gem install sds-rest
6. Download the sds-radiant application and unzip it to a folder on your hard drive.
7. Signup for a SDS account at http://www.microsoft.com/azure/default.mspx and then enter your credentials in the 
ssds.yml file.
8. Create an SDS authority and enter the value in the ssds.yml file.
9. Open a command prompt and navigate to that directory and type "rake db:bootstrap"
10. Then type "ruby script/server"
11. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and you will see the task application up and running.
